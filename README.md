### NTDG - Not a Three-Dimensional Game.
## "What is this?"
This is a simple "2.5D" game written in C programming language using ray tracing.  
It uses [Termbox2](https://github.com/termbox/termbox2) for rendering graphics in terminal.
## "How to build this?"
Run `mkdir build && cd build`.  
Then `cmake ..`.  
And then.. It depends.
## "Why its code is sooo baaad?"
I am writing in C for the first time. Would appreciate you leaving feedback about good and bad things I made.
